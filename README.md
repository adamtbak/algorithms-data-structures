# algorithms-data-structures

Hello. This repository is a collection of different algorithms and data structures that are introduced in the book, "Data Structures and Algorithms Using Java", written by William McAllister. This repository is not an all-inclusive set of all the algorithms and data structures that are presented in the book. It currently contains the examples that I have been working on as I make my way through the text. If you see any errors or have any ideas on how I could improve this code please let me know.

If anyone is interested, here are the details of the book:
